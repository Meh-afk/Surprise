      Happy birthday Heemanshu,
  Can't believe it's already been almost 2 years since that long ass bus ride to Kolkata and the day you decided to make Sankalp and I walk 10 km trying to catch up with your brother. It's been almost over a year I've even seen you fight with teachers and scare me with your hyena laughter.
  And unpopular opinion, but I did kind of enjoy when 60 of us used to be together, crammed in a little room, pushing someone else for space. Basically I miss sleeping in class without being spotted and Def the drame :D ❤.
  Continue with your stand up and the next time we'll all go to kgp to see hot guys and also root for you.
  Byeee, enjoy your day and eat mutton if you can ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ❤

          <p>Hi Heemanshu, I hope you are doing well :), Happy Birthday YYaaar!!!, have a great day amidst this madness. Bake yourself a cake, and soon enough all your friends will be asking you for a grand party. If Darshana gives you a supper tatti gift, just ask her to order ghar ka rasahan for you, she is pretty good at saving money, and will get you terrific discounts by harassing the 24/7 available sales ladies. Also, a pretty good singer herself, ask her to put a one-woman show for you. There are to lengths to which I can speak about how Darshana can entertain you, given that I am a terrific spokesperson for my girl, but this day is yours, so go ahead ask her for anything. If she refuses, ping me, I'll hide her cheese Maggi for the rest of the decade. ; )
Cheers!!
Prithu ❤️</p>

  Wish you achieve your stand up comedy dreams. Wish you And Darshana 久久.
  Thank you for taking care of mah fren even though I know she can be a little dense and hot-headed at times. Thank you for being patient and trying to understand her.
  Through the time I’ve spent with Darshana, I’ve come to realize that she’s very straightforward and speaks her mind and that’s what I like about her, her honesty, but people also misunderstand and alienate her because of that. I’m glad you were there for her during those times. Thank you for making her your priority.
  Even though I’ve never talked to you before but I hope you guys last because she’s told me only good things about you.

                <p>So the big man turns 21 today, it means existential crisis zyada frequently hoga. But nai hona chahiye, u know why? Because you are already “the most intelligent comic of comedy highway”. I’m eagerly waiting for your Netflix special tho. Keep doing comedy, stay and make people happy with your jokes.
 I still remember our first conversation, where in you were so fucking terrified of me because I was constantly teasing and annoying you. I cherish those days, who knows if we will be in touch after college. But I’m reminding you that you are one of the closest friends I currently have in my life. You have been a great friend and support system for me, understood all my problems and have had my back. All our fights, arguments have taught us lessons and we have learnt from it. You are more like my mirror image, sometimes depressed, short-tempered but smart (unlike me).
Just keep writing your one liners, because personally I love listening to your jokes, I’m sure many do. Keep improving on how to play chess and not poker, for obvious reasons. And do what you love; don’t care about what others will say. Follow your dream and passion, because it’s necessary for people like us to achieve happiness in what we do. Now no more depressing and emotional talks.
The only regret I have until now, is the fact that I broke your bond with. I might not have been the actual reason, but somewhere down the line I think people have left you because of me and my ignorant, outgoing behavior around people. Some people left you this year too, because of my mistake I made last year. And I want to let you know that I’m really sorry for everything that happened. But I’m glad you haven’t let such things affect our friendship. I might have done things which might have cost the respect you have for me, but respect for you has never gone down. And it will be the same. I just wish I could make things go back to how they were at the beginning.
I have said enough, just keep in mind that I will always stand by you no matter what; will always have your back. Happiest birthday Harvey specter. Enjoy your day in quarantine.</p>

  <h3> Now now, you must be wondering.. "Darshana tu toh nhi bolne wali kya kuch" aur something like, "darshana ka pakka last hoga", and the latter is right for obvious reasons, bhai maine itni mehnat kari, toh sabse ending mein mai apna hi toh likhungi(this is also because you read the whole thing, not just skip to the end to read what's mine cough cough).
    Abh apne muh se kya hi tariff karu apni, Mere dosto ne toh already kar di, tu roz karta hai, so without further ado , I give you, The best bish you'll ever find for yourself, your no.1 supporter and fan (even though i may not show its on my face most of times),

      Hey Shoots!! Wassup, its your grill Darshana, a.k.a Raman as you know it. Happy  birthday heemya!!! 21 ka ho gaya, abh bas mere 21 ka hone ka wait kar, and then maybe we can do what you always wanted to do together.. and that is ofcourse ..... Daaru peena yrr. (we are keeping this pg-13 mind you, i ain't gonna be saying stuff that you imagine twice or thrice a week.)
      Stay happy, healthy both mentally and physcially. You have achieved a lot of milestones the past year, don't forget that. Learn from your failures and shine your talents even further so that soon people would see you on netflix and be like "Why did i make an enemy out of that guy" (also to get major bragging rights obvio).
      Small talk mai karungi nhi, cause almost daily hum wahi karne ki koshish karte hai, and we both know how much we suck at keeping the conversation flowing, but the fact that apne break-ups bhi sirf 1 din he last karte hai is a huge achievement on both our parts. Tune finally apna longest datig duration wala record todh diya, and maine apne boyfriend wala so i guess we gucci now.
      Anyways its you birthday, so enjoy the day to your fullest, apni mumma ko zyada tang maat kariyo, help her out with the household works once in a while. Do some wild stuff admist this corona state so that you don't lose your sanity, chess mein apni rating badhata rahiyo, get some books for that if you want, or maybe i can gift it to you as a birthday gift, cause as you already know "Souled store is currently not selling back covers."
      Baki aur cringey cheeze mujhe yaad nhi aa rahi except for mwuah mwuah XOXO and loads of love, yeh sabh likhne ki zaroorat nhi padhni chahiye mujhe, you already know how muh i care about you and stuff. And i sincerely hope that This measures for atleast 2 years of birthday gifts cause boi did i not invest a lot of my time and effort on this.
      Much more to listen to but first "life is not a race, its  marathon.that we can prolly run together to the finish line." Obstacles ayenge zinagi mein kaafi, but as long as you don't lose track of what you seek as the end result.
      Tada, MUJHE PARTY CHAHIYE ANE KE BAAD PAKKA WALI. bye-bye~
